### Welcome
This is a collection of some of my technical work related to quantitative finance. 

### Python in Finance
We use Python in some of our classes, and here is some of my work:

* [Black-Scholes Option Modeling in Python](https://github.com/hanxiye/qfrm-python/blob/master/Finance/python-black-scholes-merton.ipynb)

### Machine Learning
* [Support Vector Machine](https://github.com/hanxiye/Machine-Learning/blob/master/Support%20Vector%20Machine.ipynb)
* [Clustering]() : in progress
* [Hidden Markov Models]() : in progress
* [Multi-layer Neural Networks]() : in progress
* [Decision Tree and Random Forest]() : in progress

### C++ Project in Risk Management
* [Portfolio Simulation for Risk Management](https://github.com/hanxiye/umich-quant)
* This is a project supervised by our placement director [Peter Benson](https://lsa.umich.edu/math/people/staff/pbenson.html). More information about this project is available [here](https://pbenson.github.io/quant-projects/portfolio_modeling.html).

### About me
* [Resume](https://hanxiye.github.io/resume_HanxiYe.pdf)
* I am a grad student at the University of Michigan, in the [Quantitative Finance and Risk Management](https://lsa.umich.edu/math/graduates/quantitative-finance.html) program, expecting to graduate at Dec, 2016. I did my undergraduate in [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) as an economics student.
* I am interested in option pricing, asset allocation, and risk management. In summer 2016, I interned at [State Street](http://www.statestreet.com/home.html) in their Hangzhou Office, and implemented quantitative asset allocation models for a robo-advisor project.
