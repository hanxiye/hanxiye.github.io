More information about this project is available [here](https://pbenson.github.io/quant-projects/index.html).\r\n\r\n### About me\r\n* [Resume](https://github.com/hanxiye/hanxiye.github.io/blob/master/resume_1111.pdf)\r\n* I am a grad student at the University of Michigan, in the [Quantitative Finance and Risk Management](https://lsa.umich.edu/math/graduates/quantitative-finance.html) program, expecting to graduate at Dec, 2016. I did my undergraduate in [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) as an economics student.\r\n* I am interested in option pricing, asset allocation, and risk management. In summer 2016, I interned at [State Street](http://www.statestreet.com/home.html) in their Hangzhou Office, and implemented quantitative asset allocation models for a robo-advisor project.\r\n",
